# GDPR Action Plan #

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives people specific rights to manage personal data collected about them. There are several aspects of GDPR compliance. These documents are intended to provide a “road map” of key ideas, processes and considerations you will encounter to meet GDPR expectations using Microsoft products and services. Technical guidance can be found at [GDPR][GDPRlink].

The GDPR introduces new rules for companies, government agencies, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data for EU residents. The GDPR applies no matter where you or your enterprise are located.

This document summarizes a prioritized action plan to meet the requirements of the GDPR. Learn more about how to use this action plan at: Chart your Microsoft 365 compliance path and information protection strategy.

## Implementing the GDPR ##

Microsoft recommends a three phase implementation, with specific outcomes, found at [Action Plan Outcomes][APOutcomes]. As a timeline, these phases are:  
1.	Tasks that can be completed quickly, with low impact to users. ([First 30 days][30days].)  
 •	Understand your GDPR requirements and consider engaging with a Microsoft GDPR Advisory Partner  
 •	Start discovering the types of personal data you are storing and where it resides to comply with Data Subject Requests (DSRs).

2.	Tasks that take more time and planning to implement, but greatly increase data security. ([Up to 90 days][upto90days])  
 •	Start implementing compliance requirements using Microsoft 365 governance and compliance capabilities.  
 •	Use Microsoft 365 security capabilities to prevent data breaches and implement protections for personal data.

3. Important ongoing security measures that build on previous work. ([Beyond 90 days][beyond90days])  
 • Use advanced Microsoft 365 tools and information protection to implement ongoing programs for personal data.  
 • Ongoing compliance monitoring across Microsoft 365 and other Cloud applications. Consider addressing data residency requirements for EU personal data.
